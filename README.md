PROJECT DISCONTINUED 
===========

FocalLocal 
===========

What would the world be like if everywhere you went people were creating simple and fun events, reaching out all the time to the people living around them and asking them to come together and share a positive experience with each other?

Imagine how much more connected would we feel to each other if these interactions were a normal part of daily life?

What if these events and projects had the power to bring communities together, in a call for action, to deal with serious societal issues in a constructive, light-hearted, adventurous and enjoyable way?

Welcome to the Focallocal project!

Can I contribute?
